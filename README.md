## Overview

Feature toggling is a technique used to control the availability of new features in a software application. It allows developers to enable or disable features dynamically, without the need to deploy new code or restart the application. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to test new features in a production environment or roll out features gradually to a subset of users.
